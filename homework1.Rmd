# Problem 1: Identifying unknown stationary time series processes  

**[54 points.]** In the file `mysterytsUW.csv`, you will find 18 columns of time series data. Each column is an independent time series generated by your instructor to have a particular structure. That structure might include a deterministic time trend, seasonal effects, AR(p) processes, and/or MA(q) process. All of these time series can be assumed to be covariance stationary.  
For each series, your task is to make your best guess of the data generating process (DGP) which produced the data. Thus, for each time series a. to r., you should in- dicate whether you suspect the time series DGP includes any of the following four components:  

i. *deterministic trend* If you suspect a deterministic trend, indicate your evidence for that trend, describe it (e.g., with an estimate of the monthly increase or de- crease) and then remove it from the time series to yield a detrended time series for further analysis.  

ii. *seasonality* Assume the data are monthly, so that any seasonality should show up on a 12 observation cycle. In this case, assume that any seasonality present is additive.^I[Multiplicative seasonality is more common but is not used in this example.] If you suspect seasonality, describe the seasonal cycle, then remove the seasonal means from your data to yield a seasonally-adjusted time series.  

iii. *autoregression* If you suspect autoregression is present, describe the order of autoregression and the likely signs and magnitudes of terms. Be sure to use detrended and/or seasonally-adjusted data if you found either a time trend or seasonality.  

iv. *moving averages* If you suspect moving average components are present in the error term, describe the order of the moving average process and the likely signs and magnitudes of terms. Be sure to use detrended and/or seasonally-adjusted data if you found either a time trend or seasonality.  


The first 12 time series – a. to l. – contain at most one of the four components above. The remaining six time series – m. to r. – may contain more than one component.  
Use any tools you know, including graphs of the time series, correlograms of auto- correlations (ACFs), and correlograms of partial autocorrelations (PACFs). It may be useful to apply these tools to the original, detrended, and/or seasonally ajusted time series. It is not necessary to show every graph you make; often a sentence summarizing a plot will be sufficient, but if you are in doubt, show and describe the plot.  
You will be marked on the basis of your choice and use of appropriate diagnostic tools. You will not be penalized for failure to guess time series processes correctly, unless this reveals deficiencies in your understanding of diagnostic tools.  

```{r include = FALSE}
ts <- fread('data/mysterytsUW.txt') %>% mutate(month = rep(month.name, 9)[1:100], year = floor(0:99/12), date = str_c(month, '-', year), row = 1:100) %>% pivot_longer(names_to = 'series', cols = 1:18, values_to = 'value')

```


```{r figure 1}
focal_series = ts %>% filter(series == 'a')
acf(focal_series$value, main = "Figure 1: ACF of Series 'A'")
pacf(focal_series$value, main = "Figure 2: PACF of Series 'A'")
m <- arima(focal_series$value, order = c(0,2,0))
```

a. Series A looks like a MA(2) process with a small first order $\rho$, which may be positive, and a negative second-order $\rho$. I looked at the acf and pcf plots, figures 1 and 2 respectively, and was initially confused, becasue they didn't look like anything I had seen. But then I played around with the simulation code from class and realized that I could produce a similar PACF by making a second-order MA process.

b. Eyeballing B suggests some seasonality. The PACF and ACF both also have spikes on 12, which supports that intuition. Regression of the monthly values on the observation number and month further confirms this pattern: looks like something big happens in December.  

c. C pretty clearly has a deterministic trend. Regressing on the observation number confirms that intuition. We can detrend the data, as shown in figure 2.  

```{r figure 2}
focal_series = ts %>% filter(series == 'c')
trend_model = lm(value ~ row, data = focal_series)
focal_series %>% mutate(detrend = value-trend_model$fitted.values) %>% 
  pivot_longer(c(detrend, value), values_to = 'value') %>%
  ggplot(aes(row, value, color = name))+
  geom_line() + 
  scale_color_brewer(palette = 10)+
  ggtitle("Figure 2: Original and Detrened Series 'C'") +
  theme_classic()
```

d. Ok, here eyeballing and other checks count out deterministic trends. The `decomposed()` function suggests seasonality, which is confirmed by the PACF and ACF, with spikes at 12 for each. Regression analysis does not suggest particular patterns for particular months, however.  

e. Eyeballing doesn't suggest any deterministic trend. This time, though `decomposed()` agian suggests seasonality, the ACF and PACF tell a different story: this is an AR(1) process with $phi = .7$ or so.  

f. It looks like there's some seasonality in F, confirmed by decomposition, and by the ACF and PACF. Unlike in D, however, removing the monthly patterns does seem to have an effect in this case. Figure 3 and 4 show the ACF of the raw seasonality-adjusted D respectively, suggesting that the monthy pattern was the only temporal pattern present.  

```{r}
focal_series = ts %>% filter(series == 'f')
trend_model = lm(value ~ row + month, data = focal_series)
acf(focal_series$value,
     main = "Figure 3: ACF of 'D'")
acf(focal_series %>% mutate(detrend = value-trend_model$fitted.values) %>% pull(detrend),
     main = "Figure 4: ACF of Seasonality-Adjusted 'D'")
```

g. This looks like a AR(1) process with $\phi$ up around .8. This is based on an ACF with steady declines after the first lag and a PACF with only the first lag significant. Because the ACF looked different than examples of AR(1), I checked for seasonality and deterministic trends but couldn't find them. 

h. This is a MA(1) processs with MA(1) roughly equal to .5. The ACF shows a single significant value at lag one, while the PACF shows a second, opposite signed value at lag two. This is consistent with an MA process. No evidence of seasonality or deterministic trends.

i. There is no time-series process in i. Looking at ACF, PACF, regressing on the time or the period, all come up with no results. It's all shock here.

j. This has monthly seasonality with strong effects for all months. ACF and PACF have strong spikes at lag 12, and regressing on month dummies is significant. Figure 5 shows original and with seasonality removed.

```{r}
focal_series = ts %>% filter(series == 'j')
trend_model = lm(value ~ row + month, data = focal_series)
focal_series %>% mutate(detrend = value-trend_model$fitted.values) %>% 
  pivot_longer(c(detrend, value), values_to = 'value') %>%
  ggplot(aes(row, value, color = name))+
  geom_line() + 
  scale_color_brewer(palette = 10)+
  ggtitle("Figure 5: Original and de-seasoned Series 'J'") +
  theme_classic()
```

k. This has a clear deterministic trend. Looks like one with my eyes, regression on time confirms. Removing the deterministic trend produces ACF and PACF with no evidence of autocorrelation.


l. This looks like an AR(1) with a $\phi$ of about .9. If it were any higher, I'd be tempted to say that it might also be a RW(1), but the instructions don't allow for that, and it's not much higher than .9.

m. OK, now we might see two things!
Seasonality and MA(1)
First, there's some clear seasonality. ACF and PCF have significant spikes at 12, and regression on month dummies shows signiifcant month-specific intercpets. After removing those, as seen in figure 6, we can take the ACF and PACF, shown in figure 7, which look like an MA(1) process with $\ro_1$ at around .5.

```{r}
focal_series = ts %>% filter(series == 'm')
trend_model = lm(value ~ row + month, data = focal_series)
focal_series %>% mutate(detrend = value-trend_model$fitted.values) %>% 
  pivot_longer(c(detrend, value), values_to = 'value') %>%
  ggplot(aes(row, value, color = name))+
  geom_line() + 
  scale_color_brewer(palette = 10)+
  ggtitle("Figure 6: Original and Seasonality-Adjusted Series 'M'") +
  theme_classic()
pacf(focal_series %>% mutate(detrend = value-trend_model$fitted.values) %>% pull(detrend),
     main = "Figure 7: PACF of Seasonality-Adjusted 'M'")
```

n. Deterministing trend with AR(1) after de-trending. Trend looked likely in a plot, confirmed with decompose and regression. After detrending ACF and PACF showed evidence of AR(1) with declining ACF spikes and single PACF spike.

o. There is both a monthly seasonality and a deterministic trend here, identified with `decompose` and regression. After both are removed using the regression results, ACF and PACF show no significant spikes. 

p. This is monthly-seasonal, with a deterministic trend recognized and removed as in O, and an AR(1) process after detrending and removing seasonality. 

q. This shows some evidence for seasonality in the decompose and when using regression. However, adjusting the time series for seasonality doesn't seem to have much effect, so if it's there its weak and I'm going to say I don't think there's seasonality. Further evidence agianst seasonality is the lack of a spike at 12 on the ACF and PACF (thought there is a spike at 13, I think that's spurious). Instead, looking at the ACF and PACF suggests to me that this is an AR(2) with relatively small $\phi_1$ and $phi_2$, right above and below .3 respectively.





# Problem 2: Identifying unknown, possibly nonstationary time series processes  


**[15 points.]** In this problem, we focus on the problem of identifying nonstationarity. In the file `mysterytsUW2.csv`, you will find five additional time series, s. to w. Once again, each column is an independent time series generated to have a particular structure. All of these series follow some AR(p) process. No moving average processes, deterministic trends, or seasonal variation are present in these time series. However, these five time series are not guaranteed to be covariance stationary. For each time series:  

```{r}
ts %>% filter(row<21) %>% ggplot(aes(row, value))+
  geom_line()+
  facet_wrap(~series, scales = 'free')


walk(unique(ts$series), function(x) acf(ts %>% filter(series == x, row<21) %>% pull(value)))
```


i. Subset the first 20 observations. Plot them against time and plot the ACFs and PACFs. (There is no need to show these graphs on your write-up.) Based on these plots, guess the order of the AR(p), and the approximate values of the au- toregressive parameters.


ii. Subset the first 100 observations and repeat the analysis. Did any of your con- clusions change or become more or less certain?  

iii. Conduct your analysis on all 1000 observations. Did any of your conclusions change? If so, what implications does this have for assessing stationarity in time series in your field?  

```{r include = FALSE}

focal_series = ts %>% filter(series == 'q')
focal.ts <- ts(focal_series$value, start=c(2010,1), frequency=12)
plot(decompose(focal.ts))
summary(lm(value ~ row + month, data = focal_series #%>%  mutate(month = as.numeric(as_factor(month)))
           ))
trend_model = lm(value ~ row + month, data = focal_series)
focal_series %>%
  ggplot(aes(row, value))+
  geom_line() + 
  scale_color_brewer(palette = 10)+
  ggtitle("Figure 2: Original and Detrened Series 'C'") +
  theme_classic()
focal_series %>% mutate(detrend = value-trend_model$fitted.values) %>% 
  pivot_longer(c(detrend, value), values_to = 'value') %>%

  theme_classic()
acf(focal_series$value,
     main = "Figure 3: ACF of 'D'")
pacf(focal_series$value,
     main = "Figure 3: ACF of 'D'")
acf(focal_series %>% mutate(detrend = value-trend_model$fitted.values) %>% pull(detrend),
     main = "Figure 4: ACF of Seasonality-Adjusted 'D'")
pacf(focal_series %>% mutate(detrend = value-trend_model$fitted.values) %>% pull(detrend),
     main = "Figure 4: ACF of Seasonality-Adjusted 'D'")
#Set the intercept
summary(lm(value ~ row + month, data = focal_series))
```

**[31 points.]** Provide a brief (2–3 paragraph) summary of your proposed research de- sign. The key questions to answer:  

• What is the outcome studied in your analysis? What range of values can it take on?  
• Whatistheunitofanalysis?Inparticular,whatisthenumberofcross-sectional units N and the number of periods T? Is there anything unusual about the selec- tion or observation of units or time periods?  
• Is there any pattern of missing data and/or selection of data?  
• In what ways do you think different observations over time may be related (dependent) in your data?  
• Do you suspect any Gauss-Markov assumptions would violated if these data were analyzed with a simple linear regression?  
• Based on what you have learned so far, what methods might be appropriate for analyzing your data? If you have the data in hand, you should provide histograms and/or density plots of the dependent variable, as well as any other relevant diagnostics to support your answers.
